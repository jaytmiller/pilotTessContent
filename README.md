# Timeseries Integrated Knowledge Engine
This repository contains the curated content to learn how to use and access the data associated with the TESS and Kepler missions on the MAST-hosted science platform. This repo contains documents and code which teaches how to best use NASA's Kepler and TESS time series missions. It also demonstrates how to make use of the cloud-hosted data and the AWS computational environment to your analysis of these data.

This repo is intended to contain community provided and community driven content. If you see topics that are missing, users are encouraged to either open an issue or create a pull request. Several topics are intentionally left undone in the hopes that others will contribute content to this repo as appropriate.  


##Contributing Guidlines <Stolen from Notebooks page>

1. Read over the [spacetelescope notebook style guide](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/jupyter-notebooks.md). The style parts are guidelines and it is not always necessary to follow them to the letter, but contributions are expected to generally follow this guide.  However the layout and data rules in general should be followed to ensure this repository stays consistent.
2. Fork this repository
3. Create a feature branch to add or modify content (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).  You should aim to do one branch (and therefore one Pull Request) per notebook, as that will make review faster and easier. 
4. Create a new tutorial or link an existing one. 
5. Develop your notebook by adding and committing it (`git add path/to/my/notebook/notebook.ipynb`,  `git commit -m 'Added some feature'`), as many times as necessary to capture your development history.  Note that you should *never* commit a notebook with executed cells or commit large data files (see the guide).  Always "Clear Ouputs" on cells before adding/committing.
7. Push to your github fork's branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
8. Create a new Pull Request from your fork into `spacetelescope` using the GitHub web site.  Be sure to include a description that's sufficient for someone *not in your team* to understand the context of the notebook (not all reviewers will be from your team.)
