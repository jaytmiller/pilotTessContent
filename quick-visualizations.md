# Quick and Customizable Visualizations

We have written a few functions with widget front ends that work well in this JupyterHub environment. All of them direclty rely on our API. So feel free to take the code and customize them so they fulfill your purposes.


* Quick look light curves and periodograms
* Combine TIC and archive availability
* Compare TIC sources with a TESS target pixel file (see tpfplotter)
* Overlaying DSS and PanStarrs Images on TESS FFIs
