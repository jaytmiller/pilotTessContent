# Welcome to  the TESS/Kepler/K2 Science Platform
## Hosted by STScI and the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescope

This JupyterHub instance running on AWS is intended to allow you to work with MAST's time series data without having to download it. This enables you to learn how to use NASA's photometric missions and provides a place that will allow you to work with large amounts of data hosted in the the AWS public buckets. 

This area assumes you are somewhat familiar with NASA's high cadence photometric missions, but not necessarily with exactly how the data is formatted or how to best use it. If you are looking for an introduction to TESS, Kepler or K2, we recommend some of these documents.
