# Welcome to the Time series Integrated Knoweledge Engine  
![TESS Sketch](images/tess-icon.png)

This [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) instance running on AWS is intended to allow you to learn new data analysis tools, collaborate with your colleagues in a common workspace, customize data visualizations, and ultimately do research on TESS and Kepler data. 

New to JupyterHub, take this [quick tour](./tike-tour.md).

This platform is pre-loaded with python software packages and Jupyter notebook tutorials that teach how to do research with the TESS and Kepler Data (see the directory `notebooks/` on the left). We use git to pull new and updated notebooks into this instance, so if you decide to alter these notebooks for your own purposes (and we hope that you do), you should first make a copy for yourself. 

The platform includes a folder called `public/` which is publicly accessible by all users of this platform. You can use this to easily share data or code with collaborators.

If something is not working on this platform, please open an issue on github, or email the MAST help desk, archive@stsci.edu.

## A Few Starting Points

**[Learn Mission Data](./learn-data-skills.md)** Start here if you are new to TESS and are trying to learn the best way to work with TESS catalogs, retrieve light curves, and manipulate time series data.

**[Harness the Power of the Cloud](./cloud-computing.md)** These tutorials are for those wanting to learn more about how you can fully utilize this cloud computing environment with tools like Dask.

**[Science Examples](./science-examples.md)** Work flows of simple science examples that make use of MAST data and the AWS environment. Use these to see what kind of research others have done with time series data.

**[Data/Meta-Data Tools](./quick-visualizations.md)** If you are more interested in browsing the MAST data holdings and/or quickly viewing the quality of the data that is available, start here. You may use this code as a starting point to customize your own scripts for these sorts of tasks.
