# Welcome to the MAST proto-TIKE  
![TESS Sketch](tess-icon.png)

This [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) instance running on AWS is intended to allow you to learn new data analysis tools, collaborate with your colleagues in a common workspace, customize data visualizations, and ultimately perform your research on TESS and Kepler data. Learn more about the capabilities of this space with this [quick tour](./tike-tour.md).

This platform is pre-loaded with python software packages and Jupyter notebook tutorials that teach how to do research with the TESS and Kepler Data (see the directory `notebooks/` on the left). We use git to pull new and updated notebooks into this instance, so if you decide to alter these notebooks for your own purposes (and we hope that you do), you should first make a copy for yourself. 

The platform includes a folder called `public/` which is publicly accessible by all users of this platform. You can use this to easily share data or code with collaborators.

If something is missing from the platform that you need, please email the MAST help desk, archive@stsci.edu.

## A Few Starting Points

**[Learn Mission Data Skills](./learn-data-skills.md)** If you are new to TESS data products and are trying to learn the best way to work with TESS catalogs, retrieve light curves, and manipulate time series data, start here.

**[Harness the Power of the Cloud](./cloud-computing.md)** These tutorials are for those planning on making thousands of cutouts of the FFI data with TESScut, or for those wanting to learn more about how you can fully utilize this cloud computing environment with tools like Dask.

**[Quick Data Visualizations](./quick-visualizations.md)** If you are more interested in browsing the TESS and Kepler data holdings and/or quickly viewing the quality of the data that is available, start here. You may use these as a starting point to customize your own scripts for this sort of task.
