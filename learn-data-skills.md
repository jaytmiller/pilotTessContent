#Learn TESS Data Skill
In this set of tutorials we aim to show you how to select targets, retrieve data and manipulate that data to perform research tasks commonly done with light curve data.


### Intro to TESS data products
- TESS Input Catalog with astroquery
- Find data products with astroquery
- Intro to light curve and target pixel files [TESS]() | [Kepler]()
- Planet Search Data Validation light curve files
- Intro to TESS Full Frame Images (FFI)
- TESScut in the cloud

### Manipulating Light Curves with Community Software 
There are now a couple community pieces of software that provide easy ways to retrieve and manipulate data. While these are extremely convenient, we recommend understanding the basic data products of TESS before using them so that you can trace your work back to the original data files and understand the mission documentation.

- Lightcurve: An introduction 
- Lighrcurve: How to stitch together data
- Lightcurve: Detrending
- Lightcurve: Co-trending with basis vectors
- Eleanor: Making FFI light curves 
- Eleanor: Pixel-Level Inspection of your data
